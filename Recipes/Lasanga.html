This is the perfect no-cook, one-bowl summer dip to bring on a picnic or to a barbecue. Simply mix together sour cream, mayo, spinach, chopped water chestnuts, and soup mix, allow the flavors to meld in the fridge, then serve with bread, chips, or veggies. It's as easy as that and completely delicious
